# ATP-number of sets descriptive analysis in python

The goal of this analysis is to explore the ATP dataset using inferential and descriptive analytics techniques to determine what variables affect the number of sets in a tennis match. The dataset contains data from 1968 to 2018, however the analysis is limited to the matches held after 01/01/2014. The main reason for that is that tennis evolves continuously so variables that were relevant 20 years ago might have a different weight today. The analysis is also limited to best-of-three sets matches. The code can easily be used to analyse longer time periods and best-of-five matches.

Two codes have been uploaded in GitHub, one should be used with the full raw data downloaded from Kaggle, the second one can be used with the csv files uploaded in GitHub. The latter data has been reduced to meet minimum size requirements of GitHub. The analysis and end result is exactly the same for both files.
